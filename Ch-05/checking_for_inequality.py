# Checking for Inequality
# (!=) means that 2 values are not equal
# For this example we'll store a requested pizza topping in a variable and then print a message if the person did not order anchovies:
requested_topping = 'mushrooms'

if requested_topping != 'anchovies':
   print("Hold the anchovies!")
