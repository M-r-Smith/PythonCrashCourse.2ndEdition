# 5-11. Ordinal Numbers: Ordinal numbers incicate their position in a list, such as 1st or 2nd. Most ordinal numbers end in th, ecxept 1, 2, and 3.
#   -Store the numbers 1 through 9 in a list. 
#   -Loop through the list.
#   -Use an if-elif-else chain inside the loop to print the proper ordinal ending for each number. Your output should read "1st 2nd 3rd 4th 5th 6th 7th 8th 9th"
#    and each result should be on a separate line.
